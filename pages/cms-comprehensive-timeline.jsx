In its brief, the government detailed its knowledge of the pooling arrangement purpose—to reduce the economic burden of Missouri’s provider tax on participating hospitals, and to redistribute Medicaid money from hospitals that treated many low-income and uninsured patients (“winner” hospitals) to “loser” hospitals that treated few low income and uninsured patients (and therefore received much less in supplemental payments). At oral argument, the government acknowledged that pooling arrangements existed around the country in “various iterations” for twenty years.</p>
